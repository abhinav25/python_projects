    "\n",
    "1. **Simple and Readable Syntax**: Python’s syntax is clear and straightforward, making it accessible for beginners and efficient for experienced developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interpreted Language**: Python executes code line by line, which helps in debugging and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Typing**: Python does not require explicit data type declarations, allowing more flexibility.\n",

The memory management process is handled by Python’s memory manager, which optimizes memory usage, and the garbage collector, which deals with unused or unreferenced objects to free up memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Garbage collection in Python uses reference counting as well as a cyclic garbage collector to detect and collect unused data. When an object has no more references, it becomes eligible for garbage collection. The gc module in Python allows you to interact with the garbage collector directly, providing functions to enable or disable garbage collection, as well as to perform manual collection.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, shallow and deep copies are used to duplicate objects, but they handle nested structures differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shallow Copy**: A shallow copy creates a new object but inserts references to the objects found in the original. So, if the original object contains other mutable objects (like lists within lists), the shallow copy will reference the same inner objects. This can lead to unexpected changes if you modify one of those inner objects in either the original or copied structure. You can create a shallow copy using the copy() method or the copy module’s copy() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep Copy**: A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all objects found within the original. This means that even nested structures get duplicated, so changes in one copy don’t affect the other. To create a deep copy, you can use the copy module’s deepcopy() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Usage: A shallow copy is suitable when the object contains only immutable items or when you want changes in nested structures to reflect in both copies. A deep copy is ideal when working with complex, nested objects where you want a completely independent duplicate. Read our Python Copy List: What You Should Know tutorial to learn more.
